# Chill web app - find places to chill at a glance
## What is this?
Chill is a progressive web app that helps you find calming places like cafes, parks, art galleries, spas, etc.

### What was it made for?
This is my submission for Project 8 called "Neighborhood Map" at Udacity FEND Google Scholarship. Our job was to create a map web app with locations and information about the places. This information have to be fetched from a third party database.

## How to install this application?
To install this program you have to have npm installed on your computer. You have to use these commands in the console to run it :
```
npm install
npm start
```
With this you can run the web app, but you won’t get all the functions of it. 

To have a service worker you have to run 
```
npm run build
```
then follow the console instructions.

## What technologies is this built with?
This app was created by create react app and uses React.js.

## Used API
This app uses Google Maps API and Foursquare API to get and display the data.
